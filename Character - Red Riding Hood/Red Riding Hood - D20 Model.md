She doesn't fight

She might smash a big porcline Jug over someones head, 1d2+1 (-2 Str.) point of subdual damadge

But she knows all the bandits, robbers and low life, they work for her dad

And the Kings Knights think her dad is a hero, and she is well known, and well in favour with them

She's got it all sorted, who's she going to smash a jug over?

She can throw a rock I guess 1d2 (-2 Str.) bludgening damadge but as you can see it won't do any damadge
